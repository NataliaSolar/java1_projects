        An item in the machine can cost between 25 cents and 1 dollar,

        a single dollar bill to pay for the item. 
        For example, a possible sample dialog might be the following:
        Enter price of item
(from 25 cents to a dollar, in 5-cent increments):
45
You bought an item for 45 cents and gave me a dollar,
So your change is
2 quarters
0 dimes, and
1 nickels.*/
